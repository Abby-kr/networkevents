## Getting Started

To get started with NetworkEvents, follow the installation and setup instructions in the [Installation](#installation) section of the [README](README.md) file.

## Installation

To get started with NetworkEvents, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/networkevents.git
   cd networkevents

## Usage

### Frontend

1. Navigate to the `client` directory:

    ```bash
    cd client
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the frontend application:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

   This will launch the frontend on `http://localhost:3000` by default.

### Backend

1. Navigate to the `server` directory:

    ```bash
    cd server
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment (if not created yet):

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:

    - On Linux or macOS:

        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

    - On Windows:

        ```bash
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

4. Install backend dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5. Run the backend application:

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

   The backend should start running on `http://localhost:5000`.

### Additional Details

- **API Endpoints:** The API endpoints are accessible on the backend server. For example, if your backend is running locally, you can make requests to `http://localhost:5000/api/endpoint`.

- **Authentication:** [Provide details about any authentication mechanisms used in your application. For example, API keys, OAuth, JWT, etc.]

- **Database Setup:** If your application uses a database, provide instructions on how to set it up, migrate, or seed data.

- **Environment Variables:** [List any environment variables that need to be set for the application to run correctly.]

**Note:** Ensure both the frontend and backend are running simultaneously for the full functionality of the application.

Feel free to customize the instructions based on the specifics of your project. If there are additional setup steps or specific configurations, include them in this section for a comprehensive guide on running your application.
